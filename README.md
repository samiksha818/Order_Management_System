# Order_Management_System
using java

This project focuses on developing an E-commerce system using SQL to manage customers, products, orders, and carts. It aims to create and interact with a relational database using SQL queries that perform essential operations such as updating product prices, managing cart contents, and retrieving business insights. The system revolves around five core tables: customers, products, cart, orders, and order_items, each serving a distinct role in the workflow. For instance, the products table stores item details like name, price, and stock quantity, while the cart table associates customers with the products they intend to buy.

The project involves a variety of SQL operations including UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, JOIN, and aggregation functions. For example, users can modify product details like updating the price of a refrigerator, retrieve products priced below a certain amount, or identify items with low stock. Cart operations allow for removing items of a specific customer or viewing their cart content. Orders can be analyzed based on criteria such as order value, order date, or customer ID.

Advanced SQL features such as subqueries are used to retrieve products not present in any cart or to find customers who havenâ€™t placed any orders. Other subqueries help determine the percentage contribution of each product to total revenue, or identify customers with high-value purchases. The system also calculates key metrics like the total amount spent by each customer, average order value, and order frequency.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the practical use of SQL for building real-world e-commerce applications. By combining data retrieval, manipulation, and reporting capabilities, the project provides a comprehensive view of managing an online retail platform, while supporting data-driven decision-making through analytics.
